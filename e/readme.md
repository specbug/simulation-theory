It happens so that 𝐸[𝜉]=𝑒, where 𝜉 is a random variable that is defined as follows: It is the minimum number of 𝑛 such that ∑𝑛𝑖=1𝑟𝑖>1, and 𝑟𝑖 are random numbers from uniform distribution on [0,1]. Beautiful, isn't it?!

I found this elegant approach described in [this excellent paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2685243?seq=1).

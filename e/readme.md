It happens so that 𝐸[𝜉]=𝑒, where 𝜉 is a random variable that is defined as follows: It is the minimum number of 𝑛 such that ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1609237069/render.png), and 𝑟𝑖 are random numbers from uniform distribution [0,1]. Beautiful, isn't it?!

I found this elegant approach described in [this excellent paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2685243?seq=1).
